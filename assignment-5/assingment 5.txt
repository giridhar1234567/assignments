A string is clamped at both the ends and it is vibrating in 4th harmonic. the equation of the stationary wave is y=0.3 sin(0.57x) cos(200pie t). the length of the string is 

solution

 Y=0.3 sin(0.57x) cos(2 pie t)
       Y=Asin(Kx)cos(wt)
       k=0.157
       k=2 pie / lambda
       lambda = 40
       lemgth of string is 
       L = n (lambda ) / 2 
       L = 4 (40m) /2
       80m
       the length of the string is 80m
